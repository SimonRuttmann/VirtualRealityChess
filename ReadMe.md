## 🎓 Project & Context

**VR Chess** was developed during the **"Virtual Reality and Animation"** course at **Aalen University**.  
The goal was to create an immersive and interactive VR experience – and what better way than with epic dungeon chess?


This was a 3-person passion project combining:

- 🧠 **3D Modeling & Animation** (Blender)
- 🛠️ **Game Programming** (Unity / C#)
- 🧪 **Testing & Balancing**
- 🎨 **Level & FX Design**

We had a blast designing, animating, and refining every piece.


> All 3D models, board elements, and gameplay logic were developed in Unity and Blender.

## 🧠 Core Concept

Step into a medieval dungeon and play a mystical game of chess like never before.  
With full VR locomotion and interactable chess pieces, players can:

- **Explore** the board in VR
- **Select and command** chess pieces with hand tracking or controller
- **Trigger dynamic animations** during attacks
- **Play locally** against a friend (no network/AI)

This is **not just chess** – this is **Dungeon Chess Duel**.

## 🏗️ Game Design

### ♟️ Chess Pieces – Fully Modeled & Animated

Each chess piece was **modeled from scratch in Blender** and rigged with custom animations:

- **Idle animation** (when selected)
- **Move animation** (when repositioned)
- **Attack animation** (when taking an opponent)
- **Death animation** (when defeated)

> Even the **attack sequences** are choreographed!  
> When a piece captures another:
> - Both pieces face each other
> - Attacker performs its animation
> - Victim reacts with a death animation
> - The attacker takes its new position

## 🕹️ Gameplay Mechanics

- **Local PvP** – take turns playing on the same headset
- **Immersive VR locomotion** – walk around the board to get close-up views
- **Interactive selection** – choose and move pieces naturally
- **Visual feedback** – move & attack markers are shown in blue/red
- **Dynamic chess arena** – torches, chandeliers, stone walls create the atmosphere
